# syllabifyRo
This script generates the syllables of words in Romanian passed as arguments. This is a rule based approach, which does not guarantee 100% accuracy due to the etymological complexities of the Romanian language.

## usage
The script needs a dictionary of syllabification rules that it will apply, which is provided as well.
```sh
$ syllabifyRO.py -d <dictionary> <word>
```
